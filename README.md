# Punk API Beer Project

This project is a React application that interacts with the [Punk API](https://punkapi.com/) to display a collection of beers. The application includes a search function, a filter feature, and routing capabilities to navigate to detailed pages for each beer.

## Features

### Search Function

The application allows users to search for specific beers using the search functionality. Simply input the desired beer name or keyword into the search bar, and the application will display relevant results.

### Filter Function

Users can filter the displayed beers based on various criteria, providing a personalized experience. Filters may include options such as beer type, alcohol content, or any other relevant categories.

### Beer Details Page

Clicking on a beer in the list will navigate the user to a dedicated page displaying detailed information about the selected beer. This could include details such as the beer's description, image, brewing method, and more.
